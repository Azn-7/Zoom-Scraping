# Zoom-Scraping
A project designed to parse zoom links into MP4s in bulk. It allows the user to separate videos by folders to ensure organization. This project involved two separate programs for its intended purpose.

# ! THIS PROJECT WAS HEAVILY ASSISTED WITH AI (Copilot) !
I was asked by my professor to help build a program to download his many recorded zoom lectures that he had created for years. Unfortunately, none of his videos were saved locally and were at risk of deletion in a week later. As such, I created a program (with the help of AI) that will allow a user to download zoom recordings in bulk.
